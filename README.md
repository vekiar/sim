# Simple Issue Manager

This is a very small issue management system implemented with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Open `index.html` in a browser to get started. Click the `+` button in the page
header to open the card creation form. Cards appear in the inbox on the left and
can be reordered by dragging them. Selecting a card opens a reading pane on the
right where its comments can be viewed and added.
