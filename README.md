# Simple Issue Manager

This is a very small issue management system implemented with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Open `index.html` in a browser to get started. Use the form at the top of the page to create new cards.
Each card has a title, description and an area to add comments. Cards can be moved up or down in the list
using their respective buttons, or reordered by dragging and dropping them.
